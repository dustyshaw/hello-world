# hello-world
I am a sophmore, working my way towards a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering.  
My dream in life is to become some sort of Web Developer and put my work out there for everyone to enjoy and see.  
I am obsessed with creating things from nothing and I am dedicated to achieving my visions. 
It is going to be hard to get to where I want, but I know that I can do it. 
I have heard a lot about GitHub and I want to learn more about it. Sounds super helpful. 
Wish me luck <3
